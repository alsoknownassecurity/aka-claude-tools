# aka-claude-tools installer
# ──────────────────────
# Creates an ISOLATED Claude Code config folder, layers on the aka-claude-tools
# additions you select, and wires a shell alias so you can launch it by name.
#
# Mechanism: Claude Code reads its config dir from $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR. Each folder
# is fully independent (own settings, hooks, agents, sessions). The alias just
# exports that variable before launching `claude`:
#
#     alias aka='CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-aka" claude'
#
# Re-run any time. Idempotent: re-running for the same folder LAYERS in place —
# it never duplicates, and unchecking an addition you previously installed
# UNINSTALLS it (its hook/command/skill files and its settings contributions —
# hook registrations, statusLine, the permission/env rules it shipped — are
# removed). Your own rules, hooks, and files are never touched.
#
# SCOPE — this script owns the DETERMINISTIC, REPEATABLE mechanics and the
# privileged shell-rc write (the alias), nothing more:
#   • addition layering (place files + merge settings) — see apply_additions /
#     the --apply engine mode, which an agent or a CI script can invoke directly;
#   • alias creation/checking — see setup_alias / the --alias mode. install.sh is
#     the SOLE sanctioned writer of your shell rc, so the Claude-driven install
#     invokes it for the alias instead of editing the rc itself, which keeps
#     command-guard strict.
# Migrating a rich EXISTING config (reading it, deciding what to carry over,
# rewriting @-import / MCP paths) and backing-up-and-rebuilding a profile are
# JUDGMENT calls, owned by the Claude-driven install (Path A, agent-install.md) —
# it reads the whole config and reasons about it, then calls this script for the
# mechanics above. Targeting an existing dir here simply layers on top.
#
# Flags:
#   --defaults         non-interactive; accept every default (config ~/.claude-aka,
#                      alias `aka`, recommended additions, no copy of existing config).
#   --no-auth-inherit  do NOT seed the new profile's .claude.json from your existing
#                      login (use when the profile is for a DIFFERENT account).
#   --apply            DETERMINISTIC ENGINE mode: layer the additions named in
#                      $CT_ADDITIONS onto $CT_CONFIG_DIR and exit. No prompts, no
#                      alias, no auth — just the repeatable mechanics (place files,
#                      union settings onto whatever is already in the dir, reconcile
#                      retired perms, register hooks). This is the entry point Path A
#                      (agent-install.md) invokes after it has done the judgment work
#                      (scan + migrate the user's config); also usable directly for a
#                      scripted/CI fresh install. Requires CT_CONFIG_DIR + CT_ADDITIONS.
#   --alias            Create/check the launcher alias for $CT_ALIAS → $CT_CONFIG_DIR
#                      and exit. install.sh is the SOLE sanctioned writer of your
#                      shell rc, so the agent invokes THIS rather than editing the rc
#                      itself — which keeps command-guard strict.
#                      Reviews the rc + its full source chain; writes an idempotent
#                      managed block, or exits non-zero on an unresolved name
#                      collision (the caller picks another name). Requires CT_CONFIG_DIR
#                      + CT_ALIAS; implies non-interactive.

# ── uninstall a deselected addition ──────────────────────────────────────────
# A plain merge only ADDS, so unchecking an addition on a re-run used to leave
# its files and settings behind forever. These helpers remove exactly what an
# addition contributed — driven by config/additions.json (.hook/.command/.skill/
# .settings/.statusLine) so they can't drift from the install logic. All are
# idempotent: pruning something already absent is a no-op.

# Remove every settings hook registration whose command references basename $1,
# then drop any event left empty. Kit hooks are matched by their unique file
# name, so a user's own hooks (different command) are never touched.
# Fully type-robust (mirrors prune_hook_regs_resolving): every shape assumption that
# could abort jq on a malformed settings.json under `set -euo pipefail` is guarded —
#   • the event VALUE may not be an array (a string/object/number) → left as-is, then
#     dropped by the final non-empty-array select (a non-array event isn't a reg list);
#   • the inner .hooks may not be an array → treated as empty;
#   • a .hooks MEMBER may not be an object → short-circuited (never reaches .command);
#   • the .command itself may be a non-string/array (the observed object shape) → cmdstr
#     normalizes it to "" (string-as-is / array argv joined over its string elements / "").
# So `contains($b)` is always string-vs-string and a foreign-shaped reg never crashes the
# pruner (which would blank the settings threaded through the deselect pipeline).

# ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR} / ~, strip quotes, collapse whitespace).
#
# Two gates make this surgical, both protecting deliberate user customization the union
# preserves by design (see the install-merge contract):
#   • MATCHER — a user who re-scoped a kit hook's matcher (e.g. leak-guard on "WebFetch"

#   • FULL-COMMAND EQUALITY (not just same file) — a user who AUGMENTED the kit invocation
#     (e.g. `…/x.sh --extra-flag`, an env prefix, a custom bun path) keeps it: the
#     normalized commands differ, so it is not a spelling-dup and is left untouched.
# Only a pure re-spelling of the IDENTICAL command (a converted foreign profile's
# `$HOME/.claude-x/hooks/harness-pointer.sh` vs the kit's single-quoted absolute form)
