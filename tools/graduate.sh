#!/usr/bin/env bash
# aka-graduate.sh — move private-incubator (dev) work onto the PUBLIC upstream.
#
# Public is the canonical, append-only upstream: every change lands via a PR and
# main is NEVER force-pushed. This helper takes commits you developed privately
# on the dev repo (e.g. an embargoed security fix) and replays them onto a fresh
# branch off public/main as clean NEW commits — then prints the PR URL. It never
# rewrites or force-pushes public history.
#
# Because the one-time identity rewrite gave public a different root than dev,
# you cannot fast-forward between them: we cherry-pick by CONTENT, which works
# regardless of a shared base.
#
# Usage:
#   aka-graduate.sh --branch fix/foo  <dev-commit>...   # cherry-pick named commits
#   aka-graduate.sh --branch fix/foo  dev/main~3..dev/main
#
# Env: AKA_PUBLIC (public clone, default ~/coding/libs/aka-claude-tools-public)
#      AKA_DEV    (dev clone,    default: the repo this script lives in)
