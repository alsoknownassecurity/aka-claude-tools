# Upgrade migration: rtk-safe.sh → rtk-safe.ts (the in-kit .sh→.ts port). A profile that
# already has the managed-marked bash hook `rtk-safe.sh` registered is re-run with the
# CURRENT manifest (which ships rtk-safe.ts). This pins that the marker-based self-clean
# (install.sh 4d-pre2) migrates a renamed PreToolUse hook cleanly — the path the generic
# manifest/deselect pruners do NOT cover, since a `.sh` command is not full-command-equal
# to the new `.ts` command.
#
# Invariants pinned:
#   (a) the old rtk-safe.sh hook FILE is removed (no orphaned payload),
#   (b) the old rtk-safe.sh REGISTRATION is pruned (no stale/double registration),
#   (c) exactly one rtk-safe.ts registration exists, launched via bun (absolute path),
#   (d) an unrelated user-owned hook + its registration are left untouched.
#
# Fully sandboxed: fake $HOME, --no-auth-inherit; never touches a real ~/.claude*.
