# Scenario T23 — UNINSTALL/clean: full removal of a cleanly-installed NON-default
# profile. The kit ships no one-shot uninstall command; the documented procedure
# (README "Uninstall") is a manual two-step that uses the kit's own primitives:
#
#     rm -rf ~/.claude-aka                       # the profile dir
#     remove_managed_block <rc> <alias>          # the managed rc block
#
# This test installs a non-default profile (alias `aka` → ~/.claude-aka) into a
# sandbox whose rc has REAL user content above AND below the spot the block lands,
# and a separate DEFAULT ~/.claude profile seeded with its own marker file. It
# then runs the documented uninstall and asserts:
#   • the profile dir is gone,
#   • the managed rc block is removed EXACTLY (begin/end markers + alias line),
#   • the surrounding rc is byte-for-byte what it was before install (no residue,
#     no stray blank-line damage to the user's own lines),
#   • the default ~/.claude profile is never touched.
#
# remove_managed_block lives in shared/lib/common.sh — the same primitive the
# installer itself uses to drop a redundant alias block — so the uninstall path
# under test is the kit's own code, not an ad-hoc sed.
