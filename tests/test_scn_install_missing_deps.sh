# Scenario T11 (scn_install_missing_deps): INSTALL/dep-missing — graceful behavior
# when a dependency is absent from PATH. Two distinct contracts:
#
#   • jq ABSENT  → jq is the REQUIRED engine (it drives the whole settings merge).
#                  The preflight `ensure_dep jq "jq (required)" 1` must BLOCK the
#                  install (non-zero exit) and print an actionable install hint —
#                  it must NOT proceed and must NOT create the profile dir.
#
#   • bun ABSENT (jq present) → bun is the runtime for the .ts hooks (command-guard,
#                  leak-guard, statusline, rtk-safe). Selecting ANY of them with bun
#                  absent ABORTS the install (fail-closed) — shipping a default-on
#                  security guard silently disabled is worse than a failed install.
#                  A selection of ONLY non-bun additions still SUCCEEDS.
#
# Method: PATH-stubbed sandbox. We build a curated bin dir containing symlinks to
# every external tool the installer needs, then OMIT exactly one (jq, or bun) to
# simulate that tool being absent from the user's machine — without touching the
# host's real toolchain. Running with PATH=<stub> makes `command -v <tool>` fail
# for the omitted tool only.
#
# Fully sandboxed: fake $HOME, fake bash rc, --defaults --no-auth-inherit, default
# $HOME/.claude-aka target. Never touches a real ~/.claude*.
