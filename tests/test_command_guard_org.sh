# test_command_guard_org.sh — PARITY + RESILIENCE for the tiers that moved onto
# command-guard's Bash branch in the consolidation (trufflehog Tier-1 + org-marker
# Tier-2). The shared corpus (test_guards.sh) can't cover these — the org tier needs
# a compiled sidecar, and the fail-soft paths need a deliberately-broken one — so they
# live here. Invariants:
#   - org-marker (CT_EGRESS_PATTERNS via the install-compiled sidecar) BLOCKS a
#     matching OUTBOUND Bash command; allows a non-match; fires ONLY on outbound.
#   - a missing / malformed / unparseable sidecar => org tier INACTIVE but the guard
#     SURVIVES (pipe-to-shell still blocks) — never a crash that fails the whole sole
#     Bash guard open.
#   - a stale sidecar (config changed since compile) WARNS but still functions.
