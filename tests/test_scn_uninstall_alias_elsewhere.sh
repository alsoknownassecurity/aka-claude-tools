# Scenario T26 — UNINSTALL/edge: the alias name is defined BOTH in our managed
# block AND in a user-authored line ELSEWHERE in the rc.
#
# Real-world shape: the user installs the kit (alias `aka` → ~/.claude-aka lands in
# a marker-delimited managed block), and SEPARATELY has their own hand-written
# `alias aka=...` line somewhere else in the rc — e.g. a personal shortcut to a
# different command, predating or unrelated to the kit. The two coexist.
#
# The documented uninstall (README "Uninstall") is the kit's own primitive:
#
#     rm -rf ~/.claude-aka
#     remove_managed_block <rc> <alias>
#
# The contract under test: remove_managed_block deletes ONLY the marker-delimited
# managed block (begin/end markers + the alias line BETWEEN them). The user's own
# `alias aka=...` line living OUTSIDE that block must survive verbatim — uninstall
# must not greedily strip every line that happens to mention the alias name.
#
# remove_managed_block matches its markers with awk `$0==marker` (whole-line exact),
# and only suppresses lines while BETWEEN begin/end — so a user alias line that is
# neither a marker nor inside the block should be untouched. This test pins that.
#
# Fully sandboxed: fake $HOME, fake bash rc, --no-auth-inherit; never touches a real
# ~/.claude* profile.
