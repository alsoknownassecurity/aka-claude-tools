# Edge / long-run idempotency: a --clean rebuild whose timestamped backup target
# ALREADY EXISTS must not silently reset the profile and orphan the user's data.
#
# The rebuild path moves the live config dir to "$config_dir.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
# and then rebuilds from that backup. The timestamp has 1-SECOND resolution, so two
# rebuilds in the same wall-clock second collide on the backup name. `mv DIR EXISTING_DIR`
# does NOT fail — it NESTS the source inside the existing dir (backup-<T>/.claude-aka/).
# default_src then points at the OUTER (wrong-level) dir, the restore finds none of the
# user's settings.json / CLAUDE.md / projects there, and the profile is rebuilt with
# kit defaults only — exit 0, no warning, rollback trap never fires. The user's data is
# orphaned one level down in the backup. A pre-existing backup dir at that path (a
# left-over, or any same-second collision) reproduces it deterministically.
#
# Convergence invariant: re-running the rebuild must PRESERVE the profile's own state
# (CLAUDE.md, conversations, user settings), never silently reset it. RED until the
# installer guards a colliding backup path (e.g. uniquifies it, or refuses to mv onto
# an existing target).
