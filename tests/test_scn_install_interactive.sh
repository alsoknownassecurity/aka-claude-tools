# Scenario T14 (scn_install_interactive): INSTALL/edge — the GENUINE interactive
# menu path, driven over a real PTY so the installer's prompt/confirm reads from
# /dev/tty are actually exercised (CT_ADDITIONS / --defaults bypass this path, so
# it was previously untested). This drives:
#   • per-addition accept/reject  (secure-settings=Y, wrap-up=Y, everything
#     else=N) — proving the menu HONORS the selection: the accepted artifacts
#     land, the rejected ones do not.
#   • the "Set up another config folder?" multi-profile LOOP — answered Y once to
#     create a SECOND, independently-named profile, then N to finish — proving the
#     loop builds a clean second profile (own dir, own alias, own settings).
#
# Mechanism: prompt()/confirm() in shared/lib/common.sh do `read -r … </dev/tty`,
# which resolves to the process's CONTROLLING terminal — not stdin — so answers
# cannot be piped in. `expect` spawns the installer with a PTY as its controlling
# terminal and scripts the answers, the closest faithful emulation of a human at
# the menu available in a sandbox. NOT --defaults / NOT CT_ADDITIONS on purpose:
# this is the one test that walks the interactive branch.
#
# Fully sandboxed: fake $HOME, fake bash rc, --no-auth-inherit. Never touches a
# real ~/.claude*. If `expect` is unavailable the interactive assertions are
# skipped (reported), so the file degrades gracefully off-host.
