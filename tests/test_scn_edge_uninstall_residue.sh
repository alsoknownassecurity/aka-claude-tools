# Scenario (scn_edge_uninstall_residue): UNINSTALL/edge — ORPHAN alias residue
# after a collision-renamed install.
#
# Sequence the existing matrix never tests end-to-end:
#   1. The user ALREADY has their own `alias aka=...` (a non-launcher shortcut).
#   2. They install the kit. Step 5's collision handling (alias_target_elsewhere
#      → OTHER) renames our launcher to the alternate `aka2` and writes a managed
#      block keyed on `aka2` (NOT `aka`) — proven by T12 (alias_collision).
#   3. Later they uninstall, following the README "Uninstall" section VERBATIM:
#        rm -rf ~/.claude-aka
#        remove the `# >>> aka-claude-tools managed: <alias> >>>` block
#      where `<alias>` is the documented default alias `aka` — because that is the
#      only alias name the README ever names, and the chosen alias name is recorded
#      NOWHERE in the profile (no metadata file the user could consult).
#
# THE DEFECT: remove_managed_block "$RC" "aka" finds no `aka` block (ours is keyed
# on `aka2`), removes nothing, and leaves BOTH the `aka2` managed block AND its
# live `alias aka2='CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="…/.claude-aka" claude'` launcher behind —
# a DANGLING alias pointing at the now-deleted profile. That is orphan residue the
# documented uninstall cannot clear, because the user has no way to learn the
# renamed alias from the docs or the profile.
#
# This test pins the INTENDED post-uninstall state (no kit residue, dangling
# launcher gone). It is RED against current behavior — that is the point: it marks
# an open defect. When fixed (record the chosen alias for uninstall, OR document
# that a collision renames the alias and the user must remove the `<alias>2` block,
# OR ship a one-shot uninstaller that finds every `aka-claude-tools managed` block),
# it goes green.
#
# Fully sandboxed: fake $HOME, fake bash rc, --no-auth-inherit; never touches a
# real ~/.claude* profile.
