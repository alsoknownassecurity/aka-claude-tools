# exercised with a web-only install (leak-guard selected, no command-guard):
#   #47-a  A config that fails to SOURCE must not silently ship an empty "tier inactive"
#          sidecar — install warns loudly and still exits 0 (tier inactive until fixed).
#   #47-b  leak-guard has the stale-config detection command-guard also has: when
#          aka-claude-tools.config drifts from the compiled sidecar, leak-guard WARNS
#          (advisory, never blocks). The sidecar's sourceHash is computed with a portable
#          sha256 in install.sh and re-hashed by leak-guard.ts via bun's createHash over
#          the same raw config bytes — implementation-independent, so they agree.
# Fully sandboxed: fake $HOME, throwaway profile; never touches a real ~/.claude*.
