# Scenario scn_edge_concurrency: CONCURRENCY / INTERRUPTION on the --clean rebuild.
#
# The rebuild path moves the live profile aside with
#     mv "$config_dir" "$config_dir.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
# The timestamp has only SECOND granularity and a single rebuild runs in ~0.3s, so
# two rebuilds in the same wall-clock second (a double-click, a rollback-then-retry,
# a fast CI loop, a leftover same-second backup) compute the SAME backup path.
#
# When that backup path already exists as a directory, `mv DIR EXISTING_DIR` does NOT
# fail on either BSD or GNU — it NESTS the source INSIDE the existing dir
# (EXISTING_DIR/<basename>). The installer then mkdir's a fresh empty profile and
# tries to restore from $rebuild_backup, but the user's real state now lives one level
# deeper (backup/.claude-aka/...), so the restore finds nothing. Result: the live
# profile comes back EMPTY (CLAUDE.md, history, sessions all gone), the installer exits
# 0, and the log even claims "your conversations… were restored". Silent data loss.
#
# This test forces the collision deterministically by shimming `date` to a fixed value
# and pre-creating the backup dir, so it pins the bug without relying on a real race.
# Fully sandboxed: fake $HOME, fake bash rc, --no-auth-inherit. Never touches a real
# ~/.claude*.
