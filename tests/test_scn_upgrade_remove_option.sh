# T18 — upgrade / remove-option: an existing install with additions selected, then
# re-run DESELECTING some. This is the "uninstall-by-deselect" half of the
# idempotent-both-ways promise, exercised across EVERY settings footprint a single
# addition can contribute and proven surgical (only the kit's own registrations go,
# the user's own perms/env/hooks stay):
#   • a HOOK addition       (leak-guard → .hooks.PreToolUse registration + file)
#   • a STATUSLINE addition (statusline → .statusLine + file)
#   • a PERM+ENV addition   (secure-settings → .permissions.deny + .env, via settings.base.json)
# while OTHER still-selected additions (wrap-up command, harness-pointer hook)
# stay fully intact, and a second identical re-deselect is a no-op (idempotent).
# Uses CT_ADDITIONS for a deterministic non-interactive selection, mirroring
# test_uninstall.sh's install convention exactly.
